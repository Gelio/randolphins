# Randolphins API

This package contains common API definitions for the
[unsplash-proxy](../unsplash-proxy) and the [slideshow](../slideshow) UI
application.

## Building

Run

```sh
npm build
```

This step should be done automatically by [Nx](https://nx.dev/), but it does not
happen again after it runs once (at least on Ubuntu). See
<https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/19312> for more information.
